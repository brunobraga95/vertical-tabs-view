Vertical Tabs view Chrome extension


Vertical Tabs View allow you to easily access and search your tabs, using a vertically stacked UI. It also allows you to open, sort and close individual or a group of tabs.

This extension is very useful for those who end up with many tabs open without knowing the last time you even interacted with them, allowing one to easily get rid of old tabs. It also makes it easy to spot duplicated tabs and to navigate to recently opened ones.
